# ☁️ AWS EC2 Essentials Course

Welcome to my **AWS EC2 Essentials** learning journey!
This repository documents my hands-on progress through the **AWS EC2 Essentials Course** on KodeKloud — designed to build a strong foundation in **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**, one of the most fundamental building blocks of AWS.

Each lab will be documented in its own folder with a README containing:

✅ Step-by-step commands
🐛 Troubleshooting notes
💡 Key takeaways
