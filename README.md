# ☁️ AWS EC2 Essentials Course

Welcome to my **AWS EC2 Essentials** learning journey!
This repository documents my hands-on progress through the **AWS EC2 Essentials Course** on KodeKloud — designed to build a strong foundation in **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**, one of the most fundamental building blocks of AWS.

Each lab will be documented in its own folder with a README containing:

✅ Step-by-step commands
🐛 Troubleshooting notes
💡 Key takeaways

## 📘 Course Summary

By completing this course, I’ll gain practical experience and in-depth knowledge of:

* ☁️ **Amazon EC2 fundamentals** – how instances work, launch, and scale
* 🧱 **VPC networking** – subnets, route tables, Internet/NAT gateways
* 🔒 **Security configurations** – Security Groups, NACLs, and IAM roles
* ⚙️ **Instance management** – AMIs, instance types, user data scripts
* 🧩 **Automation and scaling** – Launch Templates, Auto Scaling Groups
* 🌐 **Load balancing & monitoring** – ALBs, Target Groups, CloudWatch
